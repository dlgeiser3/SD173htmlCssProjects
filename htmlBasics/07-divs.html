    <h2>Div One</h2>
    <p>Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. With practice comes confidence. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.

        It's all a game of angles. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. We'll do another happy little painting. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you.
        
        This is a fantastic little painting. Let's get wild today. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. This is unplanned it really just happens.</p>

    <h2>Div Two</h2>
    <p>Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Working it up and down, back and forth. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school.

        We'll paint one happy little tree right here. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. You need the dark in order to show the light. Let's do that again.
        
        You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.</p>

    <h2>Div Three</h2>
    <p>Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. We'll put a happy little bush here. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Here's something that's fun.

        If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. What the devil. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents.
        
        Use what you see, don't plan it. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. We don't have anything but happy trees here.</p>
